# Super Smash Bros Hangman

Hangman was an assignment that we used to get more comfertable with Javascript!  This app recreates the classic word game of Hangman online with characters from Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers line of video games. I personally enjoyed making this project, because it allowed me to put two things I love together, Smash Bros and computer science!
