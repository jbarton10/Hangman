Hangman was an assignment that we used to get more comfertable with Javascript!  This app recreates the classic word game of Hangman
online with characters from Nintendo's Super Smash Brothers line of video games. As of right now in my class I have had the most fun
making this assignment, because it has allowed me to put two things I love together into one, Computer Science and Nintendo!
